This repository contains solutions to three toy problems written in JavaScript. Each challenge is provided in a separate file and the solutions are pushed to the repository once completed. The challenges include generating student grades based on input marks, detecting the speed of a car and issuing demerit points accordingly, and calculating an individual's net salary based on input basic salary and benefits, with tax, NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, gross salary, and net salary taken into account. The code uses KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the given links. A well-written README file is included in the repository.
